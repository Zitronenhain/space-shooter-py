Learning to use PyGames. Big thanks to the Project https://github.com/clear-code-projects/5games

## prepare venv

First move into this folder and activate your venv:
```Bash
  $: virtualenv .
```
Then activate the environment:
```Bash
  $: ./bin/activate
```
If it is activated, your prompt will look different and start with the folder name in braces.
Next step is to install `pygame-ce` into your venv:
```Bash
  $: pip3 install pygame-ce
```
